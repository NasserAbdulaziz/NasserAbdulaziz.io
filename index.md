# Hi, I'm Nasser Alwulayi
### Cybersecurity Researcher | Network & Cloud Security Analyst

I am a cybersecurity specialist and final-year student focused on **Network Defense**, **Cloud Security Architecture**, and **Applied Cryptography**.

I focus on **applied research**—building practical defense tools, analyzing live network traffic, and documenting vulnerability patterns. My work bridges the gap between theoretical security models and practical infrastructure hardening.
